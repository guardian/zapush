1. DONE - fix the log directory name
2. see if I can crack open stats like java[soulmates-api:java.lang:type=GarbageCollector,name=Copy:LastGcInfo.memoryUsageAfterGc]
3. come up with a list of what I think should be monitored
4. (understand why your jvm has two garbage collectors, ConcurrentMarkSweep and Copy - on my machine I have "PS MarkSweep" and "PS Scavenge", I suspect this is becuase I have an old jvm version but want to find out)
5. create a template autogeneration page
